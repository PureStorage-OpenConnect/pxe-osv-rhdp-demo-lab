== Scenario - Persistent Storage Volume Provisioning and Availability for Virtual Machines

In this scenario, we will learn about how to provision a virtual machine
on OpenShift Virtualization with Purestorage.

=== Reminder: Accessing the Red Hat OpenShift Console

To connect to the console, click on the `OpenShift Console` tab above.

____
The `OpenShift Console` tab will open in a new browser
window.
____

We can then log in with the following credentials:

Username: `kubeadmin` Password:
`[[ Instruqt-Var key="KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD" hostname="cloud-client" ]]`

== Step 1 - Deploy a Virtual Machine

Start by logging in to the OpenShift console with the information above.

=== Task 1: Create a new VM

This will automatically start the virtual machine after a short
provisioning process.

____
It can take a couple of minutes for our VM to boot the
first time
____

Explore the tabs for this virtual machine. We can view metrics,
configure snapshots, and even view the YAML configuration to make
automating easy.
